# Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This project provides a machine learning-based solution for recommending crops and fertilizers based on various environmental factors such as soil composition, weather conditions, and rainfall. The system leverages data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the dataset and ensure the accuracy of predictions.

## Features
-Data Cleaning: Handled missing and duplicate values for better data quality.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Visualizations (pair plots, heatmaps, histograms, and box plots) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
 Analysis of target label distribution to identify imbalances.
-Statistical Summaries: Provided insights into dataset characteristics.
-Outlier Detection: Used box plots to identify and handle outliers.


## Technologies Used
-Python
-Libraries:
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib
-seaborn
-scikit-learn

## Dataset
-The dataset contains key attributes such as:

-N: Nitrogen level in soil
-P: Phosphorus level in soil
-K: Potassium level in soil
-Temperature: Average temperature in the region
-Humidity: Humidity level in the region
-pH: Soil pH level
-Rainfall: Annual rainfall
